# Controller Configuration

controller:
  ros__parameters:
    # Basic Pure Pursuit parameters
    lookahead_distance: 3.0       # Base lookahead distance (m) - increased for stability
    min_lookahead: 1.0           # Minimum lookahead distance (m) - increased to reduce oscillation
    max_lookahead: 4.0           # Maximum lookahead distance (m)
    lookahead_ratio: 0.4         # Dynamic lookahead: distance = velocity * ratio
    
    # Vehicle parameters
    wheelbase: 0.35              # Vehicle wheelbase (m)
    max_steering_angle: 0.4      # Maximum steering angle (radians)
    max_steering_rate: 2.0       # Maximum steering rate (rad/s) - limit rapid changes
    
    # Basic speed control
    target_speed: 5.0            # Default target speed (m/s)
    max_speed: 8.0               # Maximum speed (m/s)
    min_speed: 1.0              # Minimum speed (m/s)
    
    # Planner velocity integration
    use_planner_velocity: true   # Use velocity from planner
    velocity_scale_factor: 1.0   # Scale factor for planner velocity (slightly conservative)
    
    # Curvature-based lookahead adjustment
    curvature_sensitivity: 2.0   # Reduced sensitivity to prevent excessive lookahead changes
